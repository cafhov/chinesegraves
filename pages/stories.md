Mary Young/Wong Ho 黃女好 (1912 -1953) came to Australia from China in 1948. She joined her husband William Ah Young, a market gardener in Coburg. Mary had four children. Her oldest daughter was married and stayed in China. Two other daughters came with her in 1948. One daughter was born in Australia. Mary worked at the market garden to help the family business and raise her children. In China, Mary was raised in a family of high social status and hence she found life in Australia difficult. Sadly, she passed away in 1953 from complications of appendicitis.
