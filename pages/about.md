## About the Collection

This website records the graves of Chinese interred at the Melbourne General Cemetery from 1873 to 2013.

You will find details about each grave including
- Photographs of the grave that may include the headstone, a view of the plot and other possible photos such as facial portrait.
- Location of the grave plot within the cemetery
- A transcription of the headstone inscription - Details may include Names(English and Chinese), Dates, Locations of origin in China

The Melbourne General Cemetery was opened in 1853 and designed as a public park with curved pathways and rest pavilions. There are about 300,00 burials in the cemetery which include notable people such as prime ministers and premiers.

Many of the graves are already documented and discoverable via dedicated English based  websites. The Chinese are documented but important detail written in Chinese is unavailable to the public to read or discover.

Hence this website endeavours to make this important information available for researchers and genealogists to discover about the Chinese buried here. Chinese names and village names in Chinese characters are critically important for family researchers.
