The Melbourne General Cemetery was opened in 1853 and designed as a public park with curved pathways and rest pavilions. There are about 300,00 burials in the cemetery which include notable people such as prime ministers and premiers.

Many of the graves are already documented and discoverable via dedicated English based  websites. The Chinese are documented but important detail written in Chinese is unavailable to the public to read or discover.

Hence this website endeavours to make this important information available for researchers and genealogists to discover about the Chinese buried here. Chinese names and village names in Chinese characters are critically important for family researchers.
